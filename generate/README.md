# spindle-generate

This plug-in for Twine is responsible for examining a set of source triples
about some entity (which has already been processed by spindle-correlate) and:

* using the rule-base, generating the data stored as the 'proxy' entity; and
* storing some of that data in a relational database, if configured to do so,
for later querying.

For example, the rule-base might indicate that an rdfs:label triple be
generated from proxies, derived from the various different kinds of labelling
predicate which might appear in source data (dc:title, dct:title, rdfs:label
itself, and so on).

If successfully derived, rdfs:label triples would be generated where the
locally-defined 'proxy' URI is the subject, and the derived version of the
label is the object.

In other words, `spindle-generate` generates triples which reflect Spindle's
understanding of a particular entity, based upon the content of the rule-base.

There are two purposes to this: one is to allow querying of those properties
in a unified fashion; the second is to enable applications not to have to do
this work themselves unless they need to because Spindle's rule-base is not
completely aligned with their specific needs.

## Triggering updates

`spindle-generate` can be triggered in several ways:

* as part of a Twine workflow, `spindle-generate` will (re-)generate the local
proxy which represents the resource identified by the graph URI
* on the command-line, `twine -u spindle IDENTIFIER`, where `IDENTIFIER` is a
local proxy URI, an external URI, or a UUID
* by receiving an `application/x-spindle-uri` message containing a local proxy
URI, an external URI, or a UUID

This module also implements an MQ queue which Twine can be configured to use.
This implementation reads from the `state` database table which is updated by
both `spindle-correlate` and `spindle-generate` when they are configured to use
a relational database connection, and generates `application/x-spindle-uri`
messages for each of the entities in a “dirty” state.

To use this queue, add the following to the Twine configuration, adjusting
parameters as appropriate:

	[twine]
	mq=spindle+pgsql://user:password@dbhost/spindledb

	[spindle]
	db=pgsql://user:password@dbhost/spindledb

When Twine is configured as part of a cluster, the Spindle MQ implementation
will automatically load-balance between nodes.
